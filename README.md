 Developed a scalable ecommerce platform using Java Spring Boot and clean architecture principles:-
 
 • Repository Service Layers: Designed and implemented repository and service layers for efficient data access and busi

 optimizing data handling and reducing boilerplate.
 
 • RESTful API Development: Built secure, high-performance RESTful APIs for core functionalities such as product, cart,
 and order management, enhancing frontend-backend integration.
